Hi, developers! 👋

Welcome to the Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK with Next.js Workshops. 

If you want to help us to translate the workshops to your language, you can do it by following the steps in the next section.

## 📝 Steps to Translate the Workshops

1. Fork this repository
2. Inside the `workshops` folder create a new folder with the name of your language (e.g. `pt-br` for Portuguese).
3. Inside the folder you just created, create a new folder with the name of the workshop you want to translate (e.g. `tutorial-demo-01` for the Full Stack App workshop).

5. Once you finish the translation, open a pull request to the `main` branch of this repository.
