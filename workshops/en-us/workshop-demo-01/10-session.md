# Conclusion

In this workshop, we learned how to create an application using DAB (Data API Builder) and how we can integrate this application with Azure Static Web Apps in just a few minutes.

There are many other functionalities that DAB offers that were not covered in this workshop, such as:

- Support authentication via OAuth2/JWT
- Filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Support for GraphQL
- Relationship cardinality
- Role-based authorization using received claims
- Item-level security via policy expressions
- And much more.

The tool is fully open source. So if you're looking to help the community, you can contribute to the project on GitHub in the **[Discussions](https://github.com/Azure/data-api-builder/discussions)** page or even by opening a new **[issue](https://github.com/Azure/data-api-builder/issues)** in the repository.
