## Adding features

While the enthusiasm is appreciated, please don't send pull requests to add new features to the sample. Because this repository is primarily a "build your first app" tutorial, the feature set is limited, by design.

## Submitting Pull Requests

Please submit all pull requests to the `main` branch.
